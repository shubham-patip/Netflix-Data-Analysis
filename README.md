## Final Conclusion
Netflix’s strategy is heavily focused on movies and adult/young-adult audiences (TV-MA, TV-14).
  To expand further, Netflix can:
  •	Invest in family & kids categories (currently low).
  •	Strengthen regional & international TV shows, which already show strong numbers.
  •	Leverage India, UK, and Japan markets along with US for future growth.
